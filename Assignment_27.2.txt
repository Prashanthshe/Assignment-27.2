Assignment 27.2

1. Who is the customer who spent the most on rental movies?                                                                             Return his/her customer id, first name and the amount spent.

Most on rental movies = max rental rate. Amount spent = rental rate

Answer: select customer_id,first_name,rental_rate from customer_rental where rental_rate = (select max(rental_rate) from customer_rental);

   
2. Give an interesting query of your own that is not already in the assignment. The query should involve at least two joins, HAVING clause and aggregation operation. Give the answer.

Answer: select actor.first_name, actor.last_name,category.name AS name, film.description AS description,         film.rental_rate, flim.length, count(length)
        from actor
        join category on actor.actor_id = category.category_id
        join film on film.film_id = category.category_id
        group by film.length
        having length > 85         
        order by length;  


Give the English explanation:

The above query selects columns first name, last name, category name, film description, film rental rate and film length        
From table 1 (Actor)
To combine the output result from three tables, we use two joins as below.
Ie  join <table 1 (Actor).column name(actor_id) and table 2 (Category).column name(category_id)>
     Join <table 3 (Film).column name(film_id) and table 2 (Category) .column name(category_id)>
Used aggregate operator (count) (under each category name only 1 record is displayed, so count is1)
Used Having clause (Having length > 85)
